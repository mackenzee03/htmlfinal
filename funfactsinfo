    <h1>Favorite Song</h1>
    <a href="../indexx.html">Home Page</a>

    <p>This is currently my favorite song. It is called Hotel By Claire Rosinkranz. I was able to go to her concert in February. She was not going to sing this song, but I started a chant. She came out and played it for us as her encore!</p>
